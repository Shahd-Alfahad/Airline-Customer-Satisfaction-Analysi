# ✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis

This project analyzes customer satisfaction data from Invistico Airlines using data preprocessing, RDD and SQL operations, and machine learning models. 

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset includes over 120,000 records and 23 features, such as customer type, flight class, satisfaction rating, and service quality scores. The objective is to explore factors influencing satisfaction and build predictive models.

##  Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, removed outliers, encoded categorical variables, normalized features, and balanced classes.
- **RDD and SQL Analysis**: Used Spark RDDs and SQL to analyze satisfaction based on age, flight class, gender, and more.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained and evaluated models in Spark MLlib:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)

## 🎯 Best Model: Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)
- Accuracy: ~91%
- F1 Score: ~0.91
- Consistent results across different train-test splits
